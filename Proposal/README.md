\section*{Summary of Background/Motivation}
\textbf{What are the gaps between the existing literature and the pressing social and economic issues in the digital economy of complex systems involving both human and AI agents that inspire your research?} \\
\textit{Answer:} The main questions involve understanding how strategic choices between open and closed source AI models affect long-term innovation and market dynamics. These are crucial as they address sustainability and ethical implications in AI development. Current game theory literature lacks comprehensive models that account for continuous interaction and strategy evolution in AI competition. The evolving landscape of AI strategy deployment within the digital economy is a multifaceted domain that demands a closer examination of the dynamic and iterative processes involved \cite{Rishi}. Understanding how companies navigate competitive pressures, technological advancements, and market dynamics while integrating human decision-makers with AI systems is crucial \cite{Mihnea}. This integration necessitates a deep dive into the strategic adaptations made by firms to stay ahead in the market \cite{Nanyi}. Moreover, the emergence of foundation models in AI, capable of handling a wide array of tasks and possessing strong imagination abilities, showcases the transformative potential of AI in strategic decision-making \cite{Kareem}. As AI continues to advance, the interplay between open and closed source models will shape the strategic landscape, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of how strategies evolve and interact within this complex ecosystem \cite{Summary}.

\section*{Research Questions}
\textbf{What are the questions your research intends to answer and why are they important? Why are these questions not addressed by existing game theory literature?} \\
\textit{Answer:} The strategic decisions between open and closed source AI models significantly impact long-term innovation and market dynamics \cite{Shugang}. For instance, in the automotive industry, firms exhibit different behaviors when engaging in open innovation (OI) strategies, particularly in dealing with competitors and rivals \cite{Jan}. This highlights the evolving nature of innovation trends, emphasizing the shift towards upstream suppliers for technological advancements. Moreover, the deployment of AI agents in open environments faces challenges in interoperability, necessitating sustainable strategies for knowledge sharing \cite{Stefan}. These examples underscore the importance of understanding and modeling the continuous interaction and adaptation between competitors in AI competition, a facet often overlooked in existing game theory literature. Addressing these aspects is crucial for ensuring the sustainability and ethical considerations of AI development in competitive markets.

\section*{Application Scenario}
\textbf{In which real-world situation does your newly proposed game and/or solution concept apply? What literature in other disciplines such as psychology could support your mechanism?} \\
\textit{Answer:} The proposed models in the research papers can indeed be applied in technology sectors where companies face the decision of adopting open or closed source development strategies. For instance, the study by Huang et al. reveals that firms in highly competitive environments may choose to open their technologies, considering the trade-off between information and access effects on competitors' behavior \cite{Yingzi}. Additionally, Li et al. demonstrate the significant impact of embedding timing and initial impact on the influence diffusion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within open-source innovation networks, highlighting the importance of strategic decisions in innovation adoption \cite{Rui}. Furthermore, Huang et al. emphasize the role of psychological trust in moderating the relationship between knowledge spillover and firms' open innovation, showcasing how behavioral factors influence strategic choices in technology development \cite{IEEE}. These examples illustrate how behavioral foundations, such as trust and competition dynamics, can shape companies' decisions regarding open or closed source strategies and their subsequent relationships in the market.

\section*{Methodology}
\textbf{What is the key game theoretical or mechanism design framework you build upon? What computational tools and advanced technology do you integrate?} \\
\textit{Answer:} The integration of dynamic game theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma in iterative games is evident in research focusing on adaptive strategies in complex networks \cite{Daphne}. This approach involves utilizing reinforcement learning methods like temporal difference learning to optimize decision-making processes for agents, showcasing the evolution of strategies over time. Additionally, the use of computational tools such as agent-based modeling and system dynamics simulations is highlighted in the study of game theory in evolutionary biology \cite{Prisoner}. These tools provide insights into strategic behavior evolution within populations. Moreover, the incorporation of advanced technologies like AI behavioral analytics and real-time data processing can enhance traditional game theory models, enabling more adaptive and predictive insights into gameplay dynamics \cite{Dilemma}.

\section*{Preliminary Results}
\textbf{Can you provide an example where your approach significantly improves human welfare?} \\
\textit{Answer:} Utilizing open-source collaboration in AI has demonstrated significant potential for accelerating innovation and enhancing the distribution of beneficial technologies, ultimately leading to improved public health outcomes compared to closed-source models. Open data platforms like GitHub host vast amounts of open data files, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among users \cite{Anthony}. Additionally, open-source AI communities, such as those focused on building models, tools, and ecosystems, offer diverse pathways for AI development beyond traditional tech companies, showcasing the power of collaborative efforts in advancing AI technologies \cite{Content} \cite{Angelita}. By embracing open-source practices, the AI community can collectively work towards building safer, more transparent, and reliable AI systems for the future, ensuring broader accessibility and innovation in the field \cite{Jennifer}.

\section*{Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts}
\textbf{What limitations of your current research could inspire future research? How can your research improve strategic decisions in various sectors?} \\
\textit{Answer:} The critique that current dynamic game theory models often fail to adequately capture the iterative decision-making processes in scenarios involving transitions between open and closed source strategies by firms is a significant limitation in the field. This limitation primarily arises from the simplistic assumptions used in many dynamic game models, which may not allow for reversion or repeated strategy shifts once a particular path is chosen. This can lead to unrealistic representations of actual business strategies where companies often reevaluate and change their strategies based on new information and changing market conditions.

For example, consider the case of a software company that initially adopts an open-source model to gain market share and foster a community of developers. Traditional game theory might predict that once this company shifts to a closed-source model to capitalize on its investments and protect its intellectual property, it would not revert to an open-source model. However, in practice, companies often cycle between open and closed models in response to competitive pressures, technological advancements, or changes in consumer preferences. This dynamic is seen in companies like Tesla, which opened its patents in 2014 to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles but has since managed its IP more conservatively as the market has matured and competition has increased.

Furthermore, dynamic game theory models often fail to account for the context in which these decisions are made. For example, a company might decide to close its source due to competitive threats but may return to an open-source model as a strategic move to disrupt competitors or to adapt to regulatory changes promoting transparency and interoperability. This kind of strategic flexibility is noted in the technology sector, where companies like Microsoft have transitioned parts of their software ecosystems to open-source in order to leverage community contributions and foster greater innovation, despite having historically embraced a closed-source model \cite{nagle2018strategic}.

In academic discussions, such as those presented by Nagle (2018), it is argued that existing models need to integrate more complex decision trees and feedback loops that reflect the real-world strategic flexibility of firms. Without these improvements, the models will continue to provide a limited view, underestimating the strategic shifts companies might undertake in response to ongoing market dynamics.
